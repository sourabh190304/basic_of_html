    <p> Knowing how to write a paragraph is incredibly important. It’s
         a basic aspect of writing, and it is something that
          everyone should know how to do. There is a specific 
          structure that you have to follow when you’re writing a 
          paragraph. This structure helps make it easier for the 
          reader to understand what is going on. Through writing
           good paragraphs, a person can communicate a lot better through 
           their writing.
